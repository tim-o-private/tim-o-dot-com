# About Me

I have spent the majority of my career building both end-user and developer-facing Enterprise Support teams. I have taken three startups from zero to providing global, 24x7 support for some of the largest institutions on the planet, enabling revenue growth from essentially zero to tens of millions in ARR. I have run teams as small as one (myself), and as large as 50 full time employees overseen by a team of five managers.

I'm deeply technical and love working with developers and infrastructure. As an advisor or an employee, I can translate feedback from the field and support teams into actionable insight that can inform both product and engineering strategy.

More about my professional history can be found on my [resume](resume). I am currently open to both consulting opportunities or full time employment.
