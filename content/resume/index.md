[^changes]: I stood up the Enterprise Support offering for PayPal, built a support offering for channel partners (e.g.: Mastercard), and figured out how to support the launch of PYUSD and the [Lift Dollar](https://www.theblock.co/post/298706/paxos-international-yield-bearing-stablecoin-lift-dollar-usdl), among other things. 
[^docs]: Paxos had no documentation program when I started. I hired the sole team member and together we figured out how to deliver docs as code, with implementation support from Engineering.

[^crlsla]: I also defined the service levels themselves. Here and at Paxos, I basically wrote all the policies related to Support. For example, the [release support policy](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/release-support-policy) and [CockroachDB support policy](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/terms-and-conditions/cockroachdb-support-policy-old/).

### APPNEXUS [^invest]

[^invest]: AppNexus was acquired by AT&T shortly after my departure, and its name was changed to Xandr. Following another acquisition by Microsoft, it is now [Microsoft Invest](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/solutions/technology/microsoft-invest-dsp)

[^amsteam]: This was on the order of 30-40 people, with a leadership team of 5 reporting to me.
[^csat]: This was a big achievement given how badly things were going when I started. Ask me about managing through churn.
[^portal]: This is now part of the SOP whenever I start at a new company. I built portals and KBs at AppNexus, Cockroach Labs, and Paxos. I usually prefer Zendesk with a tight integration with Salesforce, but Salesforce can be a fine choice if you have developers to support the portal built out and a sane architecture.
