      You've built a strong foundation. Your revenues are growing predictably, and your services and support teams are solid.
    </p>
    <p class="font-normal">
      With product-market fit established and scalable operations achieved, you're now dealing with new challenges. Perhaps you're finding that customers have become dissatisfied with services or support over time, or you've found you've lost something in the transition from a startup to scaled organization.
    </p>
    <p class="font-normal">
      At this stage, you're focused on refinement and maintenance, and want an unbiased perspective of your team's dynamics, capabilities, and culture.
    </p>
    <h3>Let's talk. I'll explore your unique challenges and determine how I can help. If I can't, I'll help find someone who can.</h3>
